recursive solutions (alternative to iterative solutions)
recursion = a process/function that calls itself
use cases: json.parse, json.stringify are recursive functions or can be written recursively, dom traversal (trees are traversal), algorithms
involving more complicated data structures, sometimes a recursive function is easier to understand

call stack - manages what happens when functions are invoked

ex recursive solution to finding factorial

function factorial(num) {
  if (num === 1) return 1; // base case that triggers collapse of call stack
  return num * factorial(num - 1); // call itself but with a smaller input
}

pure recursion vs recursion with helper function

helper function pattern useful when you need to collect and store values (eg getting all the odd numbers in an array), basically when you need a
variable that persists between recursive function calls
instead of just calculating one value to return at the end (eg summing numbers in an array)
